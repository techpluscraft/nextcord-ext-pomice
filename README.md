Here's a quick example:

```py
import pomice
import discord
import re

from discord.ext import commands

URL_REG = re.compile(r'https?://(?:www\.)?.+')

class MyBot(commands.Bot):
    
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        super().__init__(command_prefix='!', activity=discord.Activity(type=discord.ActivityType.listening, name='to music!'))
        
        self.add_cog(Music(self))
        
    async def on_ready(self) -> None:
        print("I'm online!")
        await self.cogs["Music"].start_nodes()
     
        
class Music(commands.Cog):
    
    def __init__(self, bot) -> None:
        self.bot = bot
        
        self.pomice = pomice.NodePool()
    
    async def start_nodes(self):
        await self.pomice.create_node(bot=self.bot, host='127.0.0.1', port='3030', 
                                     password='youshallnotpass', identifier='MAIN')
        print(f"Node is ready!")


        
    @commands.command(name='join', aliases=['connect'])
    async def join(self, ctx: commands.Context, *, channel: discord.TextChannel = None) -> None:
        
        if not channel:
            channel = getattr(ctx.author.voice, 'channel', None)
            if not channel:
                raise commands.CheckFailure('You must be in a voice channel to use this command'
                                            'without specifying the channel argument.')

        
        await ctx.author.voice.channel.connect(cls=pomice.Player)
        await ctx.send(f'Joined the voice channel `{channel}`')
        
    @commands.command(name='play')
    async def play(self, ctx, *, search: str) -> None:
        
        if not ctx.voice_client:
            await ctx.invoke(self.join) 

        player = ctx.voice_client        

        results = await player.get_tracks(query=f'{search}')
        
        if not results:
            raise commands.CommandError('No results were found for that search term.')
        
        if isinstance(results, pomice.Playlist):
            await player.play(track=results.tracks[0])
        else:
            await player.play(track=results[0])

            
bot = MyBot()
bot.run("token here")
 ```
